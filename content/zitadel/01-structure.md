This section is a reference for the curious. We recommend you read this section first before reaching to your mobile phone and mess with our developers nerves

```bash
├ organization

│ ├ apps

```

You'll notice a few extra files and a `cypress` directory which relates to [testing](docs#Testing) — we don't need to worry about those right now.

> This is just a placeholder for your that you can write this nice attention hungry sections See [getting started](docs#Getting_started) for instructions

### Entities

This contains just some text

#### Organizations

This *must* import, and call, the `start` function from the generated `citadel` module:

```js
import * as citadel from '@citadel/app';

citadel.start({
	target: document.querySelector('#citadel')
});
```

In many cases, this won't work 

#### User

This is a normal Express (or [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), etc) app, with three requirements:

* it should serve the contents of the `static` folder, using for example [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv)
* it should call `app.use(sapper.middleware())` at the end, where `sapper` is imported from `@sapper/server`
* it must listen on `process.env.PORT`

Beyond that, you can write the server however you like.


#### Policy

Service workers act as proxy servers that give you fine-grained control over how to respond to network requests. For example, when the browser requests `/goats.jpg`, the service worker can respond with a file it previously cached, or it can pass the request on to the server, or it could even respond with something completely different, such as a picture of llamas.

Among other things, this makes it possible to build applications that work offline.

Because every app needs a slightly different service worker (sometimes it's appropriate to always serve from the cache, sometimes that should only be a last resort in case of no connectivity), Sapper doesn't attempt to control the service worker. Instead, you write the logic in `service-worker.js`. You can import any of the following from `@sapper/service-worker`:

* `files` — an array of files found in the `static` directory
* `shell` — the client-side JavaScript generated by the bundler (Rollup or webpack)
* `routes` — an array of `{ pattern: RegExp }` objects you can use to determine whether a Sapper-controlled page is being requested
* `timestamp` — the time the service worker was generated (useful for generating unique cache names)
